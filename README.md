# space-physics


The purpose of the <a href="https://github.com/space-physics/">Space Physics GitHub organization</a> is to have a common place for people to work on programs related to geospace analysis, without having to use "personal" GitHub repos.

A similar organization with a different focus is the <a href="https://github.com/geospace-code">Geospace Code GitHub organization</a>.
